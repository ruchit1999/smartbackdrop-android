## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of SmartBackdrop Android SDK seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. Email your findings to [security@smartbackdrop.dev](mailto:security@smartbackdrop.dev).
3. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
   - Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours
- We will investigate and provide updates on our progress
- Once the issue is confirmed, we will work on a fix
- We will coordinate the disclosure with you
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Responsible Disclosure Timeline

- **48 hours**: Initial response to vulnerability report
- **7 days**: Status update and timeline for fix
- **30 days**: Target for fix implementation
- **90 days**: Public disclosure (if not fixed)

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **No Network Permissions**: The SDK processes images locally and doesn't require network access
- **Input Validation**: All image inputs are validated before processing
- **Memory Safety**: Proper memory management and bounds checking
- **Secure Image Loading**: Uses Coil for safe image loading with validation
- **No Data Collection**: The SDK doesn't collect or transmit any user data

### Security Best Practices

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update all dependencies to latest secure versions
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all input data
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- **Code Review**: All code changes undergo security review
- **Static Analysis**: Regular security scanning of codebase

## Security Updates

### How We Handle Security Updates

1. **Immediate Response**: Critical vulnerabilities are addressed immediately
2. **Patch Releases**: Security fixes are released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1)
3. **Backporting**: Security fixes are backported to supported versions
4. **Public Disclosure**: Security advisories are published for all fixes

### Update Process

1. Vulnerability is reported and confirmed
2. Fix is developed and tested
3. Security advisory is drafted
4. Fix is released to all supported versions
5. Public disclosure is made
6. CVE is requested if applicable
